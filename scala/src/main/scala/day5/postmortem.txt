It would have been MUCH more effective to do the md5 hashing in paralell on multiple cores. A guy did part2 in 1.1s, my solution takes 14min!

This  is what enables the paralell hashing.

I wasn't happy with all the ifs I used in the scala code.
Should have used options somehow.
I also wanted to get rid of the while loop in favor of streams.
Loops and conditionals are festering grounds of bugs...

UPDATE:
posted on stack exchange code review and someone game a really good stream impl to do this.

I updated my code accordingly.
