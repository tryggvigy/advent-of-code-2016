It would have been MUCH more effective to do the md5 hashing in paralell on multiple cores. A guy did part2 in 1.1s, my solution takes 14min!

This  is what enables the paralell hashing.

I wasn't happy with all the ifs I used in the scala code. Should have used options somehow. I also wanted to get rid of the while loop in favor of streams. Loops and conditionals are festering grounds of bugs...
